_Made with Python 3.15_

## Getting started guide

Checkout to any branch, there should be one or more python files like:
* first.py
* second.py
* etc...

Each file represent one step of the test. In most cases tasks consist of two steps therefore
most common files will be **first.py** and **second.py**

In order to launch specific file **FILE_NAME** must be set, like this:

```shell
FILE_NAME=<EXECUTABLE_FILE_NAME> docker-compsoe up 
```
Otherwise, by default **first.py** is executed
